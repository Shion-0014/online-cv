career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I have a background in both machine learning engineering and control engineering, with experience in the development and deployment of machine learning models. 
      During my internships at several research institutions, I conducted research on control theory and cryptography protocols using formal verification methods. 
      Currently, I am focused on web3 technology and actively engaged in on-chain data analysis and smart contract development. 
      Additionally, I am dedicated to deepening my knowledge in the highly interesting field of zero-knowledge proofs.
